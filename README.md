# Java Password Database Manager Libary

## Post Mortem
This was a project where I attempted to learn the fundamentals of integrating a Java program with an SQL. Whilst it is capable of connecting to a DB and sending hashes / logging in, it is by no means securely connecting to the server and securely transmitting data. If you are actually looking for something secure, try looking for another project on GitHub.  

>### TL;DR
>#### Don't use the project for anything actually data secure
